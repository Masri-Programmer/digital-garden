Lately, I’ve been feeling a bit uncertain about the next step in my development journey. I'm contemplating whether to move my work to the cloud and upgrade my plan on AIT Cloud to enhance my productivity, especially in coding and improving my projects. This shift could help me be faster and more efficient in my work. But the more I think about it, I’m also leaning toward building my website with Next.js and integrating it with Obsidian.

My idea is to interface my Obsidian notes directly with the website, so I can manage content seamlessly. I want to have a **portfolio** on the website to showcase the projects I’ve worked on, and for that, I need an effective way to organize and sync my notes. I’ve been considering using an open-source solution to sync and clone my Obsidian vault directly to my device, which could allow me to upgrade and edit content as I please.

Additionally, I want to make sure I’m consistently sharing my thoughts and projects across different platforms, so I’ve compiled a list of apps I plan to post on:

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com)
    
- [Daily Dev](https://www.daily.dev/mohamadmasri)
    
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/masri.programmer/)
    
- [Medium](https://medium.com/@mohmasri9753)
    
- [My Blog](#)
    
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohamad-masri-89778915a/)
    
- [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@masri.programmer)
    

Automations will play a significant role in streamlining this process. With the ability to manage everything from one central point, I can focus on creating high-quality content and engaging with my audience.

Overall, I’m thinking about reducing the complexity of building the whole website from scratch. Instead, I could start by focusing on creating my **portfolio** page, and then add the **about**, **topics**, and other sections over time, while leveraging the flexibility that Obsidian provides to organize and manage content for my site.

I’m excited about this idea of syncing everything and having more control over how I manage and share my work. I’ll continue to refine my approach and explore open-source solutions for syncing my vault!
