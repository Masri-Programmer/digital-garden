I recently installed Obsidian and migrated all my browser bookmarks, key notes, and iCloud notes into it. I’m considering publishing my notes online.

In the future, I want to explore [[AI Automation]] for my workflow. Ideally, an[[ AI agents]] would convert my voice notes or text into structured documentation with images, references, and videos. It could even automate content publishing across LinkedIn, YouTube, and TikTok to help me grow a fan base.

## Website and Blog Plans

My website will include:

- **Portfolio** (projects I've worked on)
    
- **Topics** (insights and thoughts on different areas)
    
- **Vault** 
    
- **Services**

- **private**
    
I also plan to create an online course covering **web development from zero to mastery**, including **JavaScript, Laravel, front-end & back-end, APIs, Windows & servers**. The curriculum will be documented in my blog and Obsidian.

## Business and Branding

**Tags:** #Entrepreneurship #Branding #Business

I recently opened a company in Germany and named it **Masri - Programmer**. However, I feel that this name isn’t attractive or brandable. This makes me feel a bit demotivated, and I may consider rebranding.

## Multi-Tenant System Idea & [[CRM]]

**Tags:** #SoftwareDevelopment #MultiTenant #Enterprise

I want to build a **multi-tenant system** that includes:

- User authentication & roles
    
- E-commerce features (shipping, billing, product management)
    
- Advanced admin controls
    
- Automated processes
    

While the system is highly advanced in my head, I currently don’t have clients willing to fund such a complex project. Hopefully, I’ll find one in the future.

## Work & Development Reflections

**Tags:** #Work #SoftwareEngineering #EnterpriseDevelopment

Currently, I’m working on a [[resourceForm]]
    

The project I’m working on generates around **$1.5 million per year** and involves complex data structures, report generation, and dynamic UI components. It's helping me develop skills in **enterprise-level software engineering**.

## AI and Web Development Future

**Tags:** #AI #WebDevelopment #CareerThoughts

I worry that **web development is dying** due to AI advancements. AI tools can now generate high-quality code, making traditional web development seem less valuable. The era of AI automation is taking over, and I feel like I need to pivot towards **AI-related skills and automation**.

## Daily Life & Personal Thoughts

**Tags:** #Life #PersonalReflections #Challenges

Life is a balancing act between:

- **Full-time job**
    
- **Family responsibilities**
    
- **Hobbies (gaming, gym, swimming, meditation)**
    
- **Learning & self-improvement**
    

At **25 years old**, I’ve achieved a lot, but I still wonder how people manage everything so efficiently.

### German Language & Driving License

I’ve lived in Germany for **1.5 years** but still struggle with the language since I mainly use English. I plan to focus on learning **German** after completing my **driving license**, which should take **2-3 months**.

### Financial Situation

My **expenses are increasing**, from subscriptions and bills to healthcare and taxes. However, I feel blessed to have a stable job and financial security in Germany. I’m also interested in **crypto, stocks, and retirement investments**.

### Gaming & Fun

I recently bought:

- **Games:** [It Takes Two](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1426210/It_Takes_Two/), [Red Dead Redemption 2](https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2), [GTA V](https://www.rockstargames.com/gta-v), [A Wy Out](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1222700/A_Way_Out/) (Spring Sales)
    
- **Controllers:** 2 PC controllers (€60, on installment)
    

I’m looking forward to gaming with my **wife & friends**.

### Thoughts on Influence & Self-Worth

I’ve realized that while I’m smart and hardworking, **I don’t influence people much**. However, I mostly absorb [[positive habits]] from others and avoid bad ones. I might not be exceptionally smart, but I consider myself above average. i should do an IQ Test!

## Health & Fitness

**Tags:** #Keto #Diet #WeightLoss #Gym

- **Current weight:** 81.6 kg (down from 87.6 kg a month ago)
    
- **Diet:** **Keto** (meat, chicken, eggs, fish, no carbs)
    
- **Training:** Gym & walking before iftar
    
- **Bad habit:** Smoked today after 2 months without smoking
    

## Final Thoughts

**Tags:** #Life #Overthinking #PersonalGrowth

Every night, my mind races between business, coding, family, health, social life, investments, and more. There’s always **something to plan or worry about**.

One of my biggest challenges is **maintaining a balance in life**. There are endless responsibilities—work, family, health, finances, learning, and personal projects.

I also wonder if I should **ask my boss for a promotion**. I’ve done a lot of valuable work in the past year, and I feel like I’ve contributed significantly to the team.
